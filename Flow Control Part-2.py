# 7. Create a program that takes a list of numbers, deletes any number
# greater than 10 using del, and prints the modified list.

# create a list of numbers
# numbers = [3,12,7,15,8,10,22,6]

# # Loop through the list in reverse to avoid skipping element
# for i in range(len(numbers) - 1, -1, -1):

# 8. Write a Python program to determine eligibility for a loan. The program
# should check if the applicant’s age is between 21 and 65, has a monthly
# income above $3000, and a credit score above 700. Use nested
# conditions to ensure all criteria are met. 

# prompt the user for their details

# 9. Create a program to determine the shipping cost for an online store. If
# the purchase amount is over $50, offer free shipping; otherwise,
# calculate the shipping cost based on the delivery location (local,
# interstate, or international) using nested conditions. 

# Prompt the user for purchase amount and delivery location

# 10.Develop a program that categorizes a student's grade based on their
